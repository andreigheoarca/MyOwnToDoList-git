# My Own To Do List

# Description

--My first go at making a personal project and also at getting out from tutorial hell. 
  I chose to go with a To Do List because I felt it would be a great challenge for me
  in regards to my current knowledge level.

## Usage

// Add item
-- Items can be added by inputing a value in the input field and clicking on the icon

// Edit and Delete items
-- After an item or items are added to list, they can each be individually edited or deleted 
   depending on preference by clicking the appropriate icon.

-- Editing the item can be done by inputing a value in the input field, 
   after which the edit icon can be clicked in the tab in which the change is desired.

-- The current version was deployed with local storage features and so the items will persist 
   if the page is refreshed and it also features the editing of items in the local storage.
      
## Future considerations 

-- This was my first attempt at trying to build as much of the project by myself without simply coding along after someone in a video. It was definitely heavily inspired by the grocery list project by John Smilga but I tried to deviate as much as my current knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript allowed. 
-- As far as the building process is concerned, I have quite a long road of improvement ahead. In my opinion the project turned out quite messy as I didn't plan ahead much and I simply started typing the code while trying to figure out the general structure and functionality as I went along. I wouldn't normally approach a task like this but I thought in this case it was necessary in order for me to try to get out of tutorial hell and to get over the initial block of actually trying to code by myself. Naturally the project got quite messy and I had to rely on lots and lots of googling and sites stackoverflow or dev.to, etc. I also had to revisit certain basics regarding DOM traversal which I feel like I have a better grasp of at the moment. Also for this particular project I chose to use event bubbling in order to make my selections as opposed to John Smilga's approach, in order to challenge myself a bit and get out of my comfort zone.
-- For my future projects I definitely intend to plan things ahead way better in order to keep things nice and clean and not complicate things unnecessarily .

## Bugs and further development 

-- The project is currently deployed with Netlify and there are certain bugs in regards to the color of the text displayed in Safari on mobile and for now I plan on fixing those and adding media queries to the CSS in order to make the project responsive.
-- I will revisit the project and try to refactor or add features and improve as my knowledge grows.
